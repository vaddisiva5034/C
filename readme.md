## Introduction

This repository is a collection of practical C code snippets and programs. Whether you're just starting with C or looking to improve your skills, this repository provides examples that cover basic syntax, data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaddisiva5034/c-examples.git
cd c-examples
```

## Prerequisites

To run the C programs in this repository, you need a C compiler like **GCC** or **Clang**. You can install GCC with the following commands:

### For Linux (Debian-based systems like Ubuntu):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential
```

### For macOS (with Homebrew installed):
```bash
brew install gcc
```

### For Windows:
You can use **MinGW** or **Cygwin** to install GCC, or use **Visual Studio** to run the examples.

## How to Run the Examples

Each directory in this repository contains a specific example of C programming. To compile and run a program:

```bash
gcc -o output_file_name source_file_name.c
./output_file_name
```
